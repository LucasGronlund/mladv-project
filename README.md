# mladv-project
A project for a course in advanced machine learning.
An attempt of reproducing the paper *Text classification using string kernels* by *Huma Lodhi et al*. The paper describes a new way of performing feature extraction on documents called *String Subsequence Kernel* (SSK) and how to implement it efficiently using dynamic programming.

The results were successfully reproduced and small improvements were implemented.
