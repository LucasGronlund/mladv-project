%TODO Similarity to fastText and CNN and differences
Looking at how the Sub String Kernel behaves in comparison to for example Convoluted Neural Networks and Facebook's fastText algorithm. These both perform very well in different ways. CNN's has been shown to be able to reach very high level of performance, but takes long time to train and can be difficult to configure. fastText is very fast, training times in seconds rather than hours or days, but requires language specific understanding to work. fastText has been shown to be similiarly accurate to CNNs, but at a fraction of the computation time. fastText uses a linear classifier in its base, but uses very large, precomputed, feature vectors and several computational tricks to speed up training significantly.
